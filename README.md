# Machine Learning - Independent Research Study

## Ray Song, Duke University

This is a repo containing files from my independent research study conducted during the Spring 2018 semester at Duke University. 

For Machine Learning, [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and its pertinent libraries (*i.e.* NumPy, Pandas, and SciKit-Learn) were used primarily in my projects. Files are saved in a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) format that can be run locally. 

For more general/theoretical research on AI, Python files that run on simulated Minecraft settings were used to develop **search/learning algorithms** (A* search, minimax search & alpha-beta pruning, reinforcement learning, *etc.*)
