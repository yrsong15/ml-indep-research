# Machine Learning - Independent Research Study

## Ray Song, Duke University

This is a repo containing files from my independent research study conducted during the Spring 2018 semester at Duke University. 

For theoretical research study on AI, Python files that run on simulated Minecraft settings were used to develop **search/learning algorithms** (minimax search & alpha-beta pruning, Markov models, Bayesian estimation, reinforcement learning, *etc.*) 

For Machine Learning applications, [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and its pertinent libraries (*i.e.* NumPy, Pandas, and SciKit-Learn) were used primarily. Files are saved in a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) format that can be run locally.
